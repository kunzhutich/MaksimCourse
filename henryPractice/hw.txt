read about mutex
multiple threading 
thread safety
thread rase (competing for the same resource)

- move raw pointer to data inside control block
- make it tjread safe
- implement copy semantic for control block
-   


- read about deadlock (around mutex?)



- fix circular
- play with 91 debugger to see where the deadlock is actually located (use step into)



- break circular reference the right way
- read about atomic and use atomic for instanceCount
- linux epoll read
- linux threads
- read rpc ~interprocess communication

- think about epoll again but with JS
- implement simple threading synchronization
- hash sha256 512
- guid
- md 5 (not really safe)



- fix pop method
- keep reading about wait_for and condition_variable
- line 49 find move+delete instead of copy and delete
- template specialization
- emplace_back vs push_back

- gather requirements for use cases of application
